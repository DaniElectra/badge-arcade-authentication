# Nintendo Badge Arcade authentication

The NEX authentication server for Nintendo Badge Arcade.

## Current status

The server "works". It gets requests and sends replies, but the Nintendo 3DS errors about *maintenance* of the servers.

## Credits

The codebase of the server is based on Pretendo Network's [Wii U Chat authentication](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/wiiu-chat-authentication) server.
