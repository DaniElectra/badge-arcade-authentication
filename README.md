# Nintendo Badge Arcade authentication

The NEX authentication server for Nintendo Badge Arcade.

## Current status

The authentication server works correctly and without errors (although you may need to replace the `nex-go` library and apply the latest upstream patches).

## Credits

The codebase of the server is based on Pretendo Network's [Wii U Chat authentication](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/wiiu-chat-authentication) server.
